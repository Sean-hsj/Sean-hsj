- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m a senior college student major in Mathematics. I enjoy traveling, coding, and problem-solving. 
Iâ€™m also a shutterbug, interested in taking street snaps, portraits, and landscapes.

- ðŸ’» As a passionate software developer, I have been working on coding for three years. I have worked on projects including web-based, full-stack applications, mobile multi-threaded applications for iOS, and front-end development using React.js.

- ðŸ¤– I am working on a full stack multi vendor restaurant web application by Django framework at this time. 

- ðŸ“« I am currently looking for a Software Engineering internship for Spring/Summer 2023. Feel free to connect with me or reach out to me at houshaojie0619@gmail.com.
